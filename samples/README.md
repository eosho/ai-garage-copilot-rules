# Sample Implementations

This directory contains sample code and working examples that demonstrate how to use the AI Garage Copilot Development Pattern.

## Purpose

The samples provided here serve as practical, real-world examples of the output generated by following the agentic development workflow. You can use them to:

-   **Understand the final output**: See what a production-ready component looks like.
-   **Verify instruction effectiveness**: Check how the coding instructions are applied.
-   **Test prompt workflows**: Run the prompts and compare your results to the samples.

Each sample corresponds to a specific use case and is built using the instructions and prompts in the `.github` directory.
