# Workflow Guide

This guide walks you through the complete agentic development process, from initial idea to production-ready implementation.

## Overview

The agentic development workflow consists of four main stages:

1. **üí° Idea Discovery** - Transform concepts into structured requirements
2. **üìã Development Planning** - Break down requirements into actionable tasks
3. **üèóÔ∏è Solution Architecture** - Design technical implementation approach
4. **‚ö° Rapid Prototyping** - Generate working code following best practices

Each stage builds upon the previous one, creating a systematic approach to solution development.

## Stage 1: Idea Discovery

### Purpose
Transform raw ideas into comprehensive Product Requirements Documents (PRDs) through structured discovery questions.

### Prompt
**File**: `new-idea.prompt.md`
**Mode**: Interactive questioning

### Process
1. **Run the prompt**:
   ```
   Command Palette ‚Üí Chat: Run Prompt ‚Üí new-idea.prompt.md
   ```

2. **Provide your initial idea**:
   - Describe your concept in 1-2 sentences
   - Don't worry about being complete - the prompt will guide you

3. **Answer discovery questions** across these areas:
   - **Problem Definition**: What problem are you solving?
   - **Target Users**: Who will use this solution?
   - **Value Proposition**: What makes this valuable?
   - **Scope & Features**: What functionality is needed?
   - **Business Context**: Budget, timeline, constraints
   - **Success Metrics**: How will you measure success?

### Expected Output
**File**: `PRD.md`
**Contents**:
- Executive Summary
- Problem Statement
- Target Users & Personas
- Solution Overview
- Functional Requirements
- Non-Functional Requirements
- User Stories
- Success Metrics
- Timeline & Milestones
- Budget & Resources

Discovery Questions:
- What specific connection problems do remote teams face?
- What team sizes are you targeting?
- What features would provide the most value?
- How is this different from Slack or Teams?
- What's your budget and timeline?

Output: Comprehensive PRD.md with detailed requirements
```

## Stage 2: Development Planning

### Purpose
Convert PRD requirements into detailed development plans with features broken down into specific, actionable tasks.

### Prompt
**File**: `development-plan.prompt.md`
**Mode**: Interactive planning

### Process
1. **Run the prompt**:
   ```
   Command Palette ‚Üí Chat: Run Prompt ‚Üí development-plan.prompt.md
   ```

2. **Reference your PRD**:
   - Provide the path to your PRD.md file
   - Highlight key features and requirements

3. **Answer planning questions**:
   - **Team Context**: Team size, skill levels, availability
   - **Technical Preferences**: Technology stack, existing systems

```

## Stage 3: Solution Architecture

### Purpose
Design the technical architecture, system components, and technology stack based on requirements and development plan.

### Prompt
**File**: `solution-architecture.prompt.md`
**Mode**: Technical design consultation

### Process
1. **Run the prompt**:
   ```
   Command Palette ‚Üí Chat: Run Prompt ‚Üí solution-architecture.prompt.md
   ```

2. **Provide project context**:
   - Reference PRD.md and Development-Plan.md
   - Highlight technical requirements and constraints

3. **Answer architecture questions**:
   - **System Characteristics**: Scale, performance, availability
   - **Technical Constraints**: Security, compliance, integration
   - **Technology Preferences**: Language, framework, cloud platform
   - **Team Skills**: Existing expertise and learning capacity

### Expected Output
**Files**:
- Architecture documentation
- System diagrams (text-based, can be converted to visual)
- Technology recommendations
- Infrastructure requirements

### Example
```
Input: PRD and plan for team connection app

Architecture Questions:
- Expected number of concurrent users?
- Real-time messaging requirements?
- Data privacy and security needs?
- Preferred cloud provider?

Output: Microservices architecture with React Native, Node.js, PostgreSQL, Redis, AWS deployment
```

## Stage 4: Rapid Prototyping

### Purpose
Generate working prototype code that follows project standards and demonstrates core functionality.

### Prompt
**File**: `start-prototyping.prompt.md`
**Mode**: Implementation guidance

### Process
1. **Run the prompt**:
   ```
   Command Palette ‚Üí Chat: Run Prompt ‚Üí start-prototyping.prompt.md
   ```

2. **Choose prototype type**:
   - **API Endpoints** (FastAPI, Express, ASP.NET)
   - **CLI Tool** (Python Click, Node.js Commander)
   - **UI Component** (React, Vue, Angular)
   - **Database Schema** (SQL, NoSQL)

3. **Follow specialized prompts**:
   - Comprehensive prototyping with dedicated discovery process
   - Example: `start-prototyping.prompt.md` for any prototype type (APIs, web apps, scripts, etc.)

### Expected Output
**Working code** including:
- Core functionality implementation
- Proper error handling
- Security considerations
- Documentation and tests
- Configuration and deployment setup

### Example
```
Input: Team connection app architecture

Prototype Choice: API Endpoints  
Specialized Prompt: start-prototyping.prompt.md

Questions:

- Validation needs? (Email format, team size limits)

Output: Complete FastAPI application with:
- User management endpoints
- Team creation and management
- Message posting and retrieval
- Authentication middleware
- Input validation
- Error handling
- API documentation
```

## Workflow Integration

### Sequential Execution
Each stage builds on the previous one:

```

```

### Iterative Refinement
You can revisit any stage to refine outputs:

```
Prototype feedback ‚Üí Update Architecture ‚Üí Revise Plan ‚Üí Enhance PRD
```

### Parallel Development
Some activities can happen in parallel:

```
Architecture Design ‚Üê‚Üí Development Planning
Backend Prototype ‚Üê‚Üí Frontend Prototype
```

## Best Practices

### Preparation
1. **Clear workspace** - Start in the right project directory
2. **Gather context** - Have any existing requirements or constraints ready
3. **Time allocation** - Plan adequate time for each stage
4. **Team involvement** - Include relevant stakeholders in discovery

### Execution
1. **Follow the sequence** - Each stage builds on the previous one
2. **Be thorough** - Detailed answers lead to better outputs
3. **Document decisions** - Capture rationale for future reference
4. **Review outputs** - Validate generated documents before proceeding

### Iteration
1. **Start simple** - Begin with core functionality
2. **Build incrementally** - Add features in logical order
3. **Test early** - Validate assumptions with prototypes
4. **Gather feedback** - Use stakeholder input to refine approach
