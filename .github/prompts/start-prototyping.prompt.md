# Start Prototyping

This prompt will help you decide what kind of prototype to build for your new idea.

## What kind of prototype would you like to build?

Please choose one of the following options to get started:

1.  **[API Endpoint](./fastapi-endpoints.prompt.md)**: Generate the initial FastAPI endpoints for a web service.
2.  **[CLI Tool]**: Outline the structure and commands for a command-line interface tool. _(This can be a future prompt file)_
3.  **[UI Component]**: Design a user interface component. _(This can be a future prompt file)_

Select an option to proceed with generating the initial code for your prototype.
