# Start Prototyping

I'll help you rapidly create a working prototype for your idea. I can build any type of prototype you need, from APIs and web apps to CLI tools, data processors, or specialized components.

**If you have a PRD (Product Requirements Document)**, I can automatically analyze it and prototype the most appropriate solution based on your requirements, user stories, and technical specifications.

## Prototyping Approach

When you provide a PRD or describe what you want to prototype, I will:

1. **Analyze requirements** - Review PRD specifications or understand your vision through questions
2. **Choose optimal technology** - Recommend the best tools for your specific prototype
3. **Design the structure** - Plan the architecture and component organization
4. **Generate working code** - Create functional prototype following best practices
5. **Provide deployment guidance** - Include instructions for running and testing

## Starting Points

### **Option 1: From PRD** (Recommended)
If you have a PRD.md file, provide the file path or paste the contents. I'll:
- Analyze the requirements and user stories
- Determine the best prototype type (API, web app, CLI, etc.)
- Select appropriate technology stack
- Generate code that demonstrates core functionality

### **Option 2: From Idea Description**
Describe what you want to build, and I'll ask clarifying questions to understand your needs.

## Types of Prototypes I Can Create

## Key Questions I'll Ask

### **Functionality & Scope**
- What is the primary purpose of this prototype?
- What are the core features that must work?
- Who will use this and in what context?
- What does success look like for this prototype?

### **Technical Preferences**
- Do you have preferred programming languages or frameworks?
- Are there existing systems this needs to integrate with?
- What platforms does this need to run on?
- Are there performance or scale requirements?

### **Constraints & Requirements**
- What's your timeline for this prototype?
- Are there specific security or compliance needs?
- What level of polish is needed (rough proof-of-concept vs demo-ready)?
- Will this prototype become production code?

## Prototype Characteristics

### **Rapid Development Focus**
- **Working functionality** over perfect architecture
- **Core features** implemented and demonstrable
- **Quick iteration** capability for testing ideas
- **Clear next steps** for enhancement or production development

### **Quality Standards Applied**
- **Security practices** appropriate for prototype stage
- **Error handling** for graceful failure and debugging
- **Documentation** for understanding and extending
- **Testing approach** suitable for validation and iteration

### **Technology Selection**
- **Optimal tools** for rapid development in chosen domain
- **Minimal dependencies** to reduce complexity
- **Developer-friendly** setup and configuration
- **Clear upgrade path** to production-ready solutions

## Let's Start Prototyping

**Tell me what you want to build! Describe your idea, and I'll ask the right questions to create a working prototype that demonstrates your concept.**

Examples of how to start:
- "I need a tool that converts CSV files to different formats"
- "Build a simple chat application for my team"
- "Create a dashboard to monitor website uptime"
- "Make a game where players guess random numbers"
- "Build an API that processes image uploads"
- "Create a script that automates my daily tasks"

The more specific you are, the better I can tailor the prototype to your exact needs!
