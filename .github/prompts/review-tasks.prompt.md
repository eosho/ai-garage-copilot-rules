## Review Checklist

### 1. Design & Architecture
- Code is modular, cohesive, and follows SOLID/KISS principles.
- No excessive duplication; separation of concerns maintained.

### 2. Functionality & Logic
- Implementation meets **all acceptance criteria** from `TASKS.md`.
- Edge cases and boundary conditions are correctly handled.

### 3. Dependencies & Imports
- All dependencies are **resolvable, necessary, and minimal**.
- No unused imports, libraries, or dead code.
- No critical dependencies missing.

### 4. Standards & Style
- Consistent naming conventions, formatting, and typing (if applicable).
- No linting errors or obvious style violations.
- Code is idiomatic for the language used.

### 5. Security
- Inputs validated; outputs sanitized.
- Secrets/credentials are **never hardcoded or logged**.
- Secure APIs, queries, and storage practices (e.g., parameterized queries, encryption).
- Access control and authorization enforced where relevant.

### 6. Documentation
- Public functions/classes include docstrings or comments.
- README or component-specific docs updated if feature behavior changed.
- Configuration, environment variables, or API contracts are documented.

### 7. Testing
- Unit tests cover **new logic paths**.
- Integration/e2e tests present if feature spans components.
- Edge cases and negative paths tested.
- Tests are **readable, maintainable, and deterministic**.

### 8. Error Handling
