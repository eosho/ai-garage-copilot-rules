# New Idea to PRD Development Prompt

I'll help you transform your raw idea into a comprehensive Product Requirements Document (PRD) through interactive discovery and grooming questions.

## Interaction Approach

When you present your idea, I will:

1. **Ask clarifying questions** to understand the core problem and solution
2. **Gather detailed requirements** through targeted questions
3. **Validate assumptions** and scope with you
4. **Create a structured PRD** based on our discussion

## Discovery Questions I'll Ask

I'll systematically ask about:

### **Problem & Opportunity**
- What specific problem are you solving?
- Who has this problem and how painful is it?
- What solutions exist today and why aren't they sufficient?

### **Users & Market**
- Who are your target users?
- What are their key characteristics and behaviors?
- How will they discover and adopt your solution?

### **Solution Definition**
- What's your core value proposition?
- What are the must-have vs nice-to-have features?
- What constraints or requirements do you have?

### **Success & Scope**
- How will you measure success?
- What does MVP look like vs the full vision?
- What's your timeline and available resources?

## Final Deliverable

After our discovery session, I will create a comprehensive **PRD.md** file in your workspace that includes:

### **PRD Structure**
- **Executive Summary** - One-page overview of the solution
- **Problem Statement** - Clear definition of the problem being solved
- **Target Users & Personas** - Detailed user profiles and use cases
- **Solution Overview** - High-level description of the proposed solution
- **Functional Requirements** - Detailed feature specifications
- **Non-Functional Requirements** - Performance, security, scalability needs
- **User Stories & Acceptance Criteria** - Actionable development requirements
- **Success Metrics & KPIs** - How success will be measured
- **Timeline & Milestones** - High-level project phases
- **Technical Considerations** - Architecture and technology constraints
- **Risks & Mitigation Strategies** - Potential issues and solutions

### **Next Steps After PRD Creation**
1. **[Design Solution Architecture](./solution-architecture.prompt.md)** - Technical architecture design
2. **[Create Development Plan](./development-plan.prompt.md)** - Feature breakdown and task planning
3. **[Start Prototyping](./start-prototyping.prompt.md)** - Begin MVP development

## Let's Start

**Please describe your idea or solution concept, and I'll ask targeted questions to develop it into a comprehensive PRD document.**

### **Success Metrics**
- How will you know if this idea is successful?
- What metrics will you track?
- What does "done" look like?

## 3. **PRD Generation**

Based on your answers, I'll help you create a comprehensive PRD that includes:

- **Executive Summary**
- **Problem Statement**
- **Target Users & User Personas**
- **Solution Overview**
- **Functional Requirements**
- **Non-Functional Requirements**
- **User Stories & Acceptance Criteria**
- **Success Metrics & KPIs**
- **Timeline & Milestones**
- **Technical Considerations**
- **Risks & Mitigation Strategies**

## 4. **Next Steps**

Once your PRD is complete, we can proceed with:

1.  **[Design the Solution Architecture](./solution-architecture.prompt.md)**: Define the technical architecture and technology stack.

2.  **[Create a Detailed Development Plan](./development-plan.prompt.md)**: Break down the PRD into actionable development tasks and sprints.

3.  **[Start Prototyping](./start-prototyping.prompt.md)**: Begin building a proof of concept or MVP.

Let's start with your initial idea description, and then I'll guide you through the discovery questions to build a comprehensive PRD.
