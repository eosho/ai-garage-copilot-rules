# New Idea to PRD Development Prompt

This prompt will help you transform a raw idea into a well-structured Product Requirements Document (PRD) through a comprehensive discovery and grooming process.

## 1. **Initial Idea Capture**

Please provide a high-level description of your new idea, feature, or solution.

**Your Idea:**

> ${input:Please describe your idea here...}

## 2. **Discovery Questions**

I'll ask you a series of questions to help refine and structure your idea. Please answer as thoroughly as possible:

### **Problem Definition**
- What specific problem are you trying to solve?
- Who experiences this problem most acutely?
- How are people currently solving this problem (if at all)?
- What pain points exist with current solutions?

### **Target Users & Market**
- Who is your primary target user/customer?
- What are their key characteristics (demographics, behaviors, needs)?
- How large is this potential user base?
- Are there secondary user groups to consider?

### **Value Proposition**
- What unique value does your solution provide?
- Why would users choose your solution over alternatives?
- What's the core benefit that users will experience?
- How will you measure success?

### **Scope & Requirements**
- What are the must-have features for the initial version?
- What features would be nice to have but not essential?
- Are there any technical constraints or requirements?
- What integrations or dependencies are needed?

### **Business Context**
- What are the business goals this idea supports?
- What's the expected timeline for delivery?
- What resources (team, budget, tools) are available?
- Are there any compliance or regulatory considerations?

### **Success Metrics**
- How will you know if this idea is successful?
- What metrics will you track?
- What does "done" look like?

## 3. **PRD Generation**

Based on your answers, I'll help you create a comprehensive PRD that includes:

- **Executive Summary**
- **Problem Statement**
- **Target Users & User Personas**
- **Solution Overview**
- **Functional Requirements**
- **Non-Functional Requirements**
- **User Stories & Acceptance Criteria**
- **Success Metrics & KPIs**
- **Timeline & Milestones**
- **Technical Considerations**
- **Risks & Mitigation Strategies**

## 4. **Next Steps**

Once your PRD is complete, we can proceed with:

1.  **[Design the Solution Architecture](./solution-architecture.prompt.md)**: Define the technical architecture and technology stack.

2.  **[Create a Detailed Development Plan](./development-plan.prompt.md)**: Break down the PRD into actionable development tasks and sprints.

3.  **[Start Prototyping](./start-prototyping.prompt.md)**: Begin building a proof of concept or MVP.

Let's start with your initial idea description, and then I'll guide you through the discovery questions to build a comprehensive PRD.
