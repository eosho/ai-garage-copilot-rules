## üîê Security Rule Directives

### Core Security Principles

```
@security Rule - Security by Design: Security considerations must be integrated from the initial design phase, not added as an afterthought.
```

```
@security Rule - Defense in Depth: Implement multiple layers of security controls rather than relying on a single security measure.
```

```
@security Rule - Principle of Least Privilege: Grant only the minimum permissions necessary for functionality.
```

```
@security Rule - Fail Securely: When security controls fail, the system should fail to a secure state.
```

### Input Validation and Sanitization

```
@security Rule - Validate All Input: Always validate and sanitize all input from external sources including user input, file uploads, API calls, and database queries.
```

```
@security Rule - Input Validation: Use allowlist validation (what is allowed) rather than blocklist (what is forbidden).
```

```
@security Rule - SQL Injection Prevention: Always use parameterized queries, prepared statements, or ORMs instead of string concatenation for database operations.
```

```
@security Rule - XSS Prevention: Encode all output and use Content Security Policy (CSP) headers to prevent cross-site scripting attacks.
```

### Authentication and Authorization

```
@security Rule - Strong Authentication: Implement multi-factor authentication and strong password policies.
```

```
@security Rule - Session Management: Use secure session management with proper timeout, regeneration, and invalidation.
```

```
@security Rule - Authorization Checks: Perform authorization checks on every request, not just authentication.
```

```
@security Rule - JWT Security: If using JWT tokens, use strong signing algorithms, validate all claims, and implement proper expiration.
```

### Data Protection

```
@security Rule - Encryption at Rest: Encrypt sensitive data when stored in databases, files, or other storage systems.
```

```
@security Rule - Encryption in Transit: Use TLS/HTTPS for all communications, especially when transmitting sensitive data.
```

```
@security Rule - Password Hashing: Use strong, salted hashing algorithms (bcrypt, scrypt, or Argon2) for password storage.
```

```
@security Rule - Sensitive Data Handling: Never log, cache, or store sensitive information (passwords, keys, tokens) in plain text.
```

### API Security

```
@security Rule - API Rate Limiting: Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse and denial-of-service attacks.
```

```
@security Rule - API Authentication: Secure all API endpoints with proper authentication mechanisms.
```

```
@security Rule - API Versioning: Maintain API versioning and deprecate insecure endpoints properly.
```

```
@security Rule - CORS Configuration: Configure CORS headers restrictively, only allowing necessary origins.
```

### Error Handling and Logging

```
@security Rule - Secure Error Messages: Never expose sensitive information, stack traces, or system details in error messages.
```

```
@security Rule - Security Logging: Log all security-relevant events (authentication attempts, authorization failures, input validation failures).
```

```
@security Rule - Log Protection: Protect log files from unauthorized access and tampering.
```

### Dependencies and Infrastructure

```
@security Rule - Dependency Security: Regularly update dependencies and scan for known vulnerabilities.
```

```
@security Rule - Environment Variables: Use environment variables or secure vaults for configuration secrets, never hardcode them.
```

```
@security Rule - Container Security: Follow container security best practices including non-root users and minimal base images.
```

```
@security Rule - Network Security: Implement proper network segmentation and firewall rules.
```
